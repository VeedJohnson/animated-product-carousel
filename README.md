# React Native animated product carousel

This is an implementation for a product carousel I found on dribbble [See design here]([https://dribbble.com/shots/6654320-Animated-Onboarding-Screens](https://dribbble.com/shots/3894781-Urbanears-Headphones))

The animation is achieved using the React Native Animated API

- Created a text parallax effect
- Animated the pagination indicator
- Created a ticker animation with translateY
- Animated the background circle based on active slide index
